          <p className="text-lg sm:text-2xl leading-relaxed">
            Established in 1997 by two immigrants from the Zapotec towns of
            Oaxaca, El Mundo De Mariscos started as a humble dream in the heart
            of Oceanside, CA. Founded by a husband and wife driven by tradition
            and a deep passion for food, the restaurant began as a tribute to
            their roots and a love for sharing the vibrant flavors of Mexico.
            The journey to opening El Mundo De Mariscos was paved by years of
            dedication, including their experience managing the iconic Angelo’s
            Burger, where they honed their craft and built connections with the
            Oceanside community. Fueled by a shared vision, they created a place
            that’s now a staple of North County, blending coastal seafood
            traditions with authentic Mexican cuisine. Today, El Mundo De
            Mariscos stands as a proud contribution to Oceanside’s culinary
            scene, where every dish celebrates our founders’ heritage and the
            spirit of family that brings us together. This restaurant has become
            more than just a place to eat—it’s a community hub that welcomes
            everyone to experience the true flavors of Mexico, prepared with
            pride and tradition.
